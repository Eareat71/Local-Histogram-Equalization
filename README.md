# Local-Histogram-Equalization

The python file can be implemented to locally equalize the histogram of multiple images in a source folder.
Parallel computing is use to accelerating the process.
OpenCV is a required dependecy for running these files.
The output equalized images will be saved with the same name in another folder.
